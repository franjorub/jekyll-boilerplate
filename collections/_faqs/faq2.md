title: HOW DO I REGISTER AN ACCOUNT IN PANDA EXCHANGE?
---

To register an account on the platform, enter
https://panda.exchange/, click on "ENTER" and then on "DO YOU NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT?".

Read and follow the instructions.

When making your user registration, you will receive an email with an account activation link which you must activate to continue the process.

Subsequently, the platform will indicate a QR code and / or an alphanumeric code to link Authy or Google Authenticator to Panda Exchange, which will allow you to carry out the verification in two steps and thus complete the registration process.
